# Introduction 

Working primarily on transitioning the initial project from Flash to HTML. Focused on two projects, an internal CMS to cover the key requirements that make an avatar display for users, and the public facing application that primarily targets the students in either primary or secondary.

Tech stack worked on:
* React v15 -> framework
* Redux -> global state manager
* Cypress -> Automated UI testing
